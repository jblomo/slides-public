** Hi :notes:
   + Engineering Manager on one of Yelp's Data mining teams
   + Lots of interesting talks specifically about Hadoop
   + This talk is a bit different: it's about the stuff *around* Hadoop
   + How does Hadoop fit into our ecosystem, and some useful analogies that I
     use when thinking about how to best use it

* Step Back :slide:
  + What's the ideal data store?
  + *Fast*: ingestion, point lookups, analytics, batch processing
  + *Big*: user data, all events, no archiving
  + *Flexible*: no downtime for schema changes, hold any type of data without
    preparation
** Ideal :notes:
   + We want something that is fast, in all the ways. OLTP, OLAP, machine
     learning. We want an algorithm, we run it on this data storage
   + Obviously we need to handle tons of data, and we're realizing it can be
     best to throw nothing away
   + One of the rallying cries for NoSQL is ability to just throw stuff into a
     data storage without planning a consistent schema ahead of time. So let us
     do that!
   + Store and process any type of formatted data, not just text with arbitrary
     fields: multimedia, like images or video.
   + Who has this data store? Who has a single place that can handle all these
     things?

* Doesn't Exist :slide:center:
  [[file:img/true.jpg]]
** Unfortunately :notes:
   + Unfortunately, this data store doesn't exist
   + Engineering is fundamentally about trade-offs, and when making a system
     fast for one purpose, you might make it unsuited for another
   + So what do we do? Can't have what we want, so we throw a fit. right?

* Multiple Systems :slide:
  + Use systems well suited for a purpose
  + Different purposes => different systems
  + Trade-off: management complexity
** No Fits :notes:
   + So we can't have it all in one system, we use multiple systems
   + We'll get into the specifics later, but the big idea, and one you've
     heard before, is use the tool for the job
   + Now, we're still making a trade-off here! Managing multiple systems is
     typically more difficult than an all-in-one system

* Transforming Data :slide:
  + Most important management problem: having the right data!
  + Hadoop *transforms data* from a format required for one purpose, to a *new
    format* required for another
  + Create an independent *view* of the data
** Answer :notes:
   + Ultimately, this is the answer to the question "Oh Hadoop, where Art
     thou?"
   + Hadoop is in the middle of all of the systems that have been chosen to
     fulfill a specific purpose
   + "view" has a specific database meaning that I think is appropriate for
     Hadoop. I'll explain this a bit.
   + but first: of course Hadoop transforms data... don't all programs? How is
     this way of thinking different?

* Contrast :slide:two_col:
  + You have big data? You need a Hadoop.
  + Analytics too slow? You need a Hadoop.
  + Running out of memory? You need a Hadoop.
  [[file:img/transformed.jpg]]
** Alternatives :notes:
   + The alternative to this view that Hadoop's best fit is transforming data
     for appropriate systems is that Hadoop is the solution itself for
     whatever problem you have
   + Most typical is "too much data? use Hadoop to process it", but lots of
     variation
   + This puts too much focus on Hadoop, and not enough on the surrounding
     systems
   + How do those systems recover from error? How do we know what the source of
     truth is? Can we re-run processing if there is more data?
   + Can't sprinkle Hadoop dust on a problem and expect it to work without
     modification
   + Let's look at some examples

* Example: Metrics :slide:
  + Metrics are summary of all events
  + Input: full resolution storage of all events
  + Output: quick lookup by time of event counts
** Ideally :notes:
   + Ideally we'd like to store all events
   + When we want metrics we just do a query of all of them: SELECT count(*)
     GROUP by day
   + But we don't have this ideal system that can quickly group over all time
   + So instead we pre-calculate the events that occurred, and put them in a
     format that can easily lookup a smaller number of data points, with some
     filters like date range

* Metrics Server :slide:
  + Metrics served out of MySQL
  + Input: JSON logs, stored in S3
  + Output: MySQL =LOAD DATA= (CSV)
** Output :notes:
   + So we view this as a transformation of data from event data in JSON
   + To a format that can be ingested by MySQL for a purpose built metrics
     system

* Contrast "Processing" :slide:two_col:
  + Read logs
  + Connect to DB
  + Increment counter

  [[file:img/politition.jpg]]
** Mutable :notes:
   + Instead of doing a transformation of data, we are using Hadoop to directly update a system
   + Still using Hadoop! Still processing big data! But not in a way that takes
     the whole system into account
   + What if all the logs were not uploaded. How do we run this job again? If
     this is filling multiple metrics and we wanted to add some, how do we
     re-run this job?

* Transform Data :slide:
  + Output of many Yelp jobs are MySQL consumable format
  + =mrjob= can be run inside a Python process, which loads data from result
  + Extreme case: avoid MySQL load from ingestion by building MyISAM files

* Building MyISAM files :slide:
  + Hadoop job downloads a CSV output
  + Local MySQL instance run on worker node
  + =LOAD DATA= executed locally, MyISAM file uploaded to S3
  + =MYI= and =MYD= files synced to MySQL datadir
** Details :notes:
   + We are still transforming data. So typically a first step in this process
     is creating CSV output. This is also useful for other applications that may
     want to use this data
   + A Hadoop job will download the CSV file, the path taken from input, and
     create a MyISAM file on a local instance of S3
   + =myisampack= is run on the result, and then uploaded to S3
   + Files downloaded locally and installed on MySQL machine. no need to
     restart, MySQL will recognize the file once it's read
   + Just another example of Hadoop's ability to produce a wide range of outputs
     from inputs: it's strength

* Database Views :slide:
  + Concept of *transformed data* has a parallel in DB world
  + Views: result set of a stored query
  + *Materialized View*: pre-executed query, results physically saved
** DB :notes:
   + Database views are defined with a query. The output of the query can itself
     be queried like a table
   + Used to simplify querying while being able to have normalized data storage.
   + Our metrics query is an example: if the database contained all events, but
     we didn't want an analyst who only cared about events per day to have to
     understand the event schema
   + Normal views will run the definition query in the background. Materialized
     views will logically run the query every time the source table is updated
     and keep around the results
   + That way, when a view is queried, it can look up a "cached" version
   + Unfortunately, these views are only available inside the database

* System Views :slide:
  + Hadoop *materializes views* of data across systems
  + Views should be updated when source data changes
  + Views *do not have state* beyond the source data
** Lessons :notes:
   + The database world has done a good job creating systems that are consistent
     and understandable
   + We can learn a lot of the lessons from their features, even if a relational
     database doesn't fit some of our problems
   + These properties allow your multiple systems to stay in sync, recover more
     easily, and the operators to understand the state and flow of data
   + A good dependency management system is essential for updating views. We
     have an opensource cron replacement called tron, but we'd like to try AWS
     Data Pipeline.

* Contrast :slide:
  + Hadoop and other process simultaneously update systems
  + There is no ultimate data store - multiple systems updated in parallel
  + Inconsistencies impossible to resolve
** Alternative to views :notes:
   + The alternative to views is that all systems have some shade of truth
   + If one data store holds events, and another holds counts of events as
     recorded from the webserver, when data is inconsistent, impossible to
     resolve.

* Source: MySQL :slide:
  + Views that combine business data with logs
  + Search Suggest: autocomplete business names
  + Queries in logs; business names in database
** Challenge :notes:
   + We regularly run algorithms that need data on behavior around and item, and
     properties of that item
   + If someone is constantly searching for Garage, offer suggestion for Garage
     Cafe
   + So we need data that is stored in the database to be available to Hadoop
     jobs that are generating metrics views
   + For some processes, we still do an adhoc upload of some data. But we are
     moving toward to more full-fledged process where all database data is made
     available to Hadoop

* =S3mysqldump= :slide:
  + =mysqldump= writes out data in =INSERT= format
  + "table change logs" capture incremental change
  + Hadoop merges incremental changes into complete dumps
  + Jobs can read merged dumps and write out another format
** Overview :notes:
   + mysqldump used to get data from MySQL
   + Python process uploads either full or partial dump to S3
   + Hadoop merges these partials dumps into a format that can be read by later
     jobs

* =mysqldump= :slide:
  + Can be used locally
  + Reliable text serialization of data
  [[file:img/piggyback.png]]
** Why :notes:
   + We currently don't allow incoming connections from our EMR Hadoop clusters
     to any database, so needed something to dump locally
   + We use Hadoop Streaming for most of our Hadoop jobs, so having a regular
     text format for data was very important
   + Alternatives like Sqoop expect to run from Hadoop, have Java serialization
     format

* Upload to S3 :slide:
  + Written using Python boto library
  + Uses multipart upload for large files
  + Open Source: https://github.com/Yelp/s3mysqldump
** Wraps up :notes:
   + The part we wrote kicks off the mysqldump, splits up the file if necessary
     for multipart uploads, handles upload
   + Open source, available for download

* Table Change Log :slide:
  + =mysql= trigger on changes to data
  + Write out change to another table
  + <table, change-type, row-id, timestamp>
** log :notes:
   + Log is used to grab IDs that have changed past a given time
   + When generating an incremental, use the timestamp to grab all IDs that have
     changed since the last upload

* Hadoop Merge :slide:
  + Merges incremental upload with the last successful merge
  + Full dumps are completed weekly to catch deleted rows, schema changes
  + Merge code can read =INSERT= format
  [[file:img/merged.jpg]]
** merge process :notes:
   + Fairly straight forward, group by identifiers in the table, and output only
     the most recent update
   + Advantage of Hadoop: can transform data from other formats

* Alternatives :slide:
  + Sqoop: Hadoop driven database extraction
  + Espresso: LinkedIn project with data change capture
  + MySQL binlog parsing
** issues :notes:
   + Sqoop already discussed: non-local, Java dependencies
   + Espresso as a installable system does not sound ready, plus would be a huge
     project to migrate to
   + Not as reliable text serialization, statement logging insufficient for many
     changes

* Overview :slide:center:
  [[file:img/hadoop-overview.png]]

* Example: Autosuggest :slide:
  + Hadoop job outputs to a format that can be loaded into our autosuggest
    service
  + Service periodically loads new data from search behavior and new businesses
  + π_searches (Logs ⨝ Business Table)
** Views :notes:
  + In database nomenclature, we could consider this a projection of search
    suggestions based on the union of activity logs and records from the business table

* Example: Externally :slide:
  + LinkedIn: *Voldemort* KV store loads in LevelDBs created in Hadoop
  + Netflix: bulk exports data from Cassandra (*Aegisthus*)
  + BackType: *ElephantDB* KV store loaded from Hadoop
** Company examples :notes:
   + LinkedIn having the same problems with loading data generated from Hadoop
     batches, so created voldemort
   + Netflix was having trouble using "normal" APIs to stream out data, so were
     able to export the SSTables directly out of Cassandra and read them with
     Hadoop
   + Hadoop's strength at being able to create views from a wide range of
     systems
   + BackType now in Twitter, created ElephantDB, which loads berkeleyDB files
     from Hadoop and can be optionally incrementally updated

* Tips: Input :slide:center:
  [[file:img/workers.png]]
** Change Gear :notes:
   + So if Hadoop's strength is transforming data, I want to talk about some tips
     for making sure your data is easily transformed and useful for a variety of
     outputs

* Logging Format :slide:
  + Use a machine parsable format for logs: JSON, Avro, etc.
  + Aim for one line per service per request
  + Use standard fields, but allow for "extras"
  + Try to log every ID on a page
** Notes :notes:
   + Yelp uses Ranger
   + We're still standardizing on fields, but still is causing some pain
   + Must allow your developers to iterate quickly, but there's two iterations
     to consider: the developer consuming the logs, and the developer logging
   + Eg. in a Yelp search result, we'd like to see every business ID we
     displayed, even if it wasn't clicked so we can collect click-through
     metrics
   + Some of your pages may have "similar items"... same deal

* Resources :slide:
  + [[http://sites.computer.org/debull/A12june/pipeline.pdf][Unified Logging Infrastructure for Data Analytics at Twitter]]
  + Uses standard fields for automated metrics calculations
  + [[http://sites.computer.org/debull/A12june/pipeline.pdf][Building LinkedIn's Real-time Activity Data Pipeline]]
  + Automatic materialized view of logs based on standard fields

* Tips: Output :slide:center:
  [[file:img/output.jpg]]

* Outputs :slide:
  + Know your S3 consistency guarantees (ie. almost none)
  + Hadoop OutputFormats provide flexibility 
  + Use standard formats and paths
** AWS :notes:
   + S3 Hint: there are almost none
   + OutputFormats can give you ability to write in almost any format: to
     multiple subdirectories, in a binary format, etc. Keep in mind the format
     you'd like to transform to, and let Hadoop do the work
   + Hive, HBase, others add-ons have expected path and output format. Even if
     you're not going to use them now, default to their standard when writing
     out. They've thought about issues and makes future compatibility easier
   + Also expect multi-file outputs. Embrace this: you can download and load in
     parallel. Work arounds are possible for 1-file output, but are tricky to
     setup

* Take Aways :slide:
  + Different performance requirements require different data formats
  + Hadoop is most effective as a system to batch transform data
  + Systems modeled as views are understandable, idempotent, robust
** Views :notes:
   + Views: mostly functional transformation of data

* Thank You :slide:center:
